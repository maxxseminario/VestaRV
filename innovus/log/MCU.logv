[11/22 14:45:30   2988s] **WARN: (SDF-808):	The software is currently operating in a high performance mode which optimizes the handling of multiple timing arcs between input and output pin pairs. With the current settings, the SDF file generated will contain the same delay information for all of these arcs. To have the SDF recalculated with explicit pin pair data, you should use the option '-recompute_delay_calc'. This setting is recommended for generating SDF for functional  simulation applications.
